Howdy,  
Recently, I was interviewed for joining of Linux User Group Ludhiana (LUG), which is a group of all the linux users in our [College][1]. I am so much excited to Work n&#8217; Learn in this group. Actually this Group is inspiring me to work more hard and making me think more logically. Personally, I really got a good feeling about this Group, so I want to dedicate my time to this Group as much I can, so to promote this Group, Promote The Linux, and everything or everyone related to Open Source. So lets see how it goes on. Hereby, I request everyone studying at GNDE College, who is to willing to work and learn under Linux, Please Join !

Thats all for now !
