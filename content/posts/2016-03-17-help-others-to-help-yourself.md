Its 00:08 AM, I started writing this post, and I am listening to [D12&#8217;s new mixtape][1]. An hour ago I was worried about getting some pending works done, the list was long and I was feeling heavy. I didn&#8217;t had a good sleep yesterday as well, three hours I guess. I wanted good sleep today, but the work was pending, and I didn&#8217;t want to keep things pending when I have schedule pre-planned.

Well, I tried couple of things to make myself relaxed, nothing worked. I talked with friends and more. Lastly I tried to help two people who were stuck at code issue; one in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!aboutgroup/greatdevelopers" target="_blank">GD</a> and one in email. After this my mood cheered up, and I started working on my pending stuff, and within couple minutes I solved three of my problems, and with this I am feeling more relaxed.

This morning I was reading <a href="https://marcjenkins.co.uk/oxford/" target="_blank">Marc Jenkins&#8217; recent Post</a> in which he wrote: “You get more out of a relationship if you expect nothing in return. Give freely and the universe has a way of paying you back.” I believed in it from long, but life gives you example often. With this, I thought to start writing blog habitually, including about my personal experiences, as this post being first of them. Also I thought to add a featured image  to these posts as I am writing this. I like to click lot of pictures, good idea to put them to good use. This one is clicked on 31st Dec 2015 at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g1092107-d1383036-Reviews-Triund_Hill-McLeod_Ganj_Dharamsala_Himachal_Pradesh.html" target="_blank">Triund Hill </a>(one of my favourte places to hang out for a week or so). With this, D12&#8217;s Mixtape is also finished, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lilsandhu/kuldip-manak-nee-putt-jattan-da/" target="_blank">Kuldeep Manak&#8217;s track</a> is on.

This is good end to a good day. Signing off.
