On trip to Rajgarh, it was our good luck to have nice bus at affordable and good price. It was fit in our budget. I was managing all monetory things, so it was a good experience to manage all the stuff, the CA experience. First stop was Pinjore, there we were served with so tasty &#8220;chid&#8217;ve&#8221; made by Ma&#8217;am, Mrs. Rai. Then we moved packed up and left for Solan, The hilly and mighty mountains were big and the rivier view sideby the road was very good. In the meantime, I was talking to Driver, he told me that you guys are calm of all who went to trip in my bus. He was also happy with us. After reaching solan, I felt cool brezes throughout my head,nose and ears. So, here we go this was cool and more comfortable place. In Rajgarh we found a awesome place to hangout, that is the camping place in Rajgarh on a bank of a river flow. We started to climb the slippery mountains in the camping area, my pants were full of durt and charcoal as I was sitting on burned trees. I seem to be luckiest, I was having my clothes, So I was like sleeping in the water and others got eyes on me, haha :). We were eating mangoes and singing songs in the chilling water of the river, and that was the memorable time. After spending 3-4 hours in the watery stuff, we left for Gurudwara Baru Sahib, We had Langer over there, it was surprising so see volunteers at langer hall of age less than 5. The day was moving so fast, it was 6 already, one of my friend got her shoes broken by trekking on the mountain. So we bought sandals for her and left the place around 6 PM. The Journey was long, it almost took 8 hours. For 1 hour we stopped at eating place &#8220;Jimidara da Dhaba&#8221;, Food was OK. we finished and reached Ludhiana by 3 AM. The thing which I cannot forget is Rai Sir singing the song &#8220;Rasta Rasta aankh meri ladi hai&#8221;, acually it is a nice song. We were short of time, but in this short span of time, we did a lot of enjoyment, everyone was happy and charming out full day. It was totally a memorble trip. Thank you GD and Thank Dr.H.S.Rai who made this Trip possible.
