When I was in 9th Standard I used to chat a lot, this habit there was all crazy in chat rooms. If you ever chatted at the time you&#8217;ll know what ASL? means. To just look cool I had this script to turn Caps on/off at very fast rate say 10 times a second and when I type it used to look like this &#8220;iH, WhATs GoING On&#8221; and it was all fun. haha.
