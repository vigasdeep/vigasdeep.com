It is 1:31 AM, 26 March 2016.

Life is beautiful in its own ways. Yesterday (few hours ago) happened a miraculously beautiful moment, when I shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDYarcAN5ql/" target="_blank">picture</a> around 8 PM yesterday, with [Kamal][1] as we like to share a lot of pictures that we capture. She understands my perspective better than most people and she is curious to see, plus, we have a rare kind of connection. Examples are there, this post being one of them.

So when I shared a picture with her, she replied that she had clicked a [similar picture][2] of a flower the same day, and even both the pictures had an insect on the flower. In addition to this, there are other similar pics we do have captured separately but they look alike. We humans call it co-incidence but there are no coincidences, that&#8217;s what I like to believe. This is the sync of nature. That&#8217;s why we are friends, I&#8217;d say of the rarest kind of connection, I am the biggie, and she&#8217;s the little intellectual curious kid (Just to me, but not a kid at all, growing exponentially). I have few people who I count on fingers with whom I have such rare connection.

I am a believer, I do believe in God and always have complete faith. His plan works in mysterious ways and keeps you dumbfounded.

Couple of days back, when we were talking, I was almost asleep, and around morning before waking up, I had this dream, which I thought is reality, but later realized, it was a dream when I checked the chat history. In the dream, I told her something about me which I don&#8217;t recall (an incident probably), and she tells me that this is second incident which tells her that I (Vigas) have grown stronger now. She was happy to see me getting stronger, I&#8217;d been through some bad phases lately by luck.

I&#8217;d like to thank her for being there indeed.

The featured image I added is to fit both the pictures in one, had to do some gimp&#8217;ing, to make the images fit into one.
