My grandfather, Dr. Gurcharan Singh Muhay was clerk in is early job days in Delhi in 1970s. He used to go to library after his job, and used to read until 3AM everyday. Later on he cleared IPS exam and became Chief of Traffic police Delhi, he also served as an editor-in-chief in [Sainik Samachar][1] &#8211; The military news magazine of Govt of India(and many other reputed jobs). He served indian government for more than 40 years, which requires a different blog post though.

To sum it up, he worked for many govt agencies and I&#8217;ve never met anyone like him. The way he lived his life and the hustle he did everyday until he died is spectacular and mind blowing. He completed his Ph.D. from GNDU Amritsar at the Age of 72, and when he went to receive the degree, he was on a wheelchair and couldn&#8217;t walk. Me and my father picked the wheelchair from each side to get the wheelchair on the stage where he was going to be awarded the degree. The Government official who was chief guest to award the degrees; came on his knees to come at the wheelchair level, placed his hands on my grandpa&#8217;s knees gently, and said, &#8220;You, Sir, are an inspiration for the young!&#8221;, the whole convocation hall stood up in honor, I was all teary standing against the wall.

Next, my father, is a different kind of hustler, he doesn&#8217;t care what anyone thinks and does what he feels is right. He was a clerk whole his life, but don&#8217;t let the title confuse you, the state level officials used to call him directly regarding work status of the office he used to work at, because he was so good at the work he did and the whole circle knew him on first name basis including the top level officials. If he was writing a letter, it would be so detailed but still so crisp at the same time. Officials also loved him for the work ethics he had. I remember vividly, he missed his lunch Â 80% of the time, whole office used to have lunch break, but he enjoyed his work so much, and was so dedicated to it, that nothing could interrupt him. He had maintained a garden outside his office and used to take care of plants regularly because he was not working for a mere paycheck..

Until this day, I have never been to a hospital for any kind of disease, I had no vaccinations ( polio etc ), because my father never let that happen, as he believed anyone who is fit and fine, does not need vaccinations based on the books he read regarding these things. He is an avid reader and learner, we have a huge pile of books at home (more than 500 or 1000, never counted). A pile that keeps increasing all the time, because my father likes to read a lot just like my Grandfather.

Lastly, my mother, does job and also has huge contribution to household works. She&#8217;s not the one who would like to sit while someone e else is working. When I have to go Â some place early in the morning, she would wake up and get me food. She gets me food at anytime of the day or night because she wants me to eat fresh. I now avoid these things as I am a grown up and can cook by myself, but point is about the Hustle she does everyday until this day, even when her body doesn&#8217;t allow, and she likes to push herself to the limit for the people she cares.

This string of Hustlers that I have in my parenting have taught me to hustle without even talking about it, kids learn what they see, and I&#8217;ve seen hustle from everyone here. This is the kind of parenting I have.

I&#8217;m grateful for the legacy and parenting I have and I&#8217;d like to contribute to that chain of hustle, not only for myself but also for the generations which are yet to come. All this somehow made me realize the importance of hustle.

Let&#8217;s consider some things which automatically happen when you hustle:

  1. You get better constantly
  2. You get confidence because you know stuff.
  3. You get respected for your work ethic.
  4. You get to make best out of your time, because its gonna run out eventually.
  5. You learn to mind your own business, which is good for you and others too.
  6. You earn good.
  7. Money becomes a secondary variable and that is very important.

All of these contribute to your happiness index eventually, and you become happier in life.

<span data-dobid="hdw">Caveat:</span> Don&#8217;t forget, work is not life, work is a small part of life. And hustle not just about work, it&#8217;s a way of living, when you get your hands on something, you better make sure you do it good with the time and resources you have.

Hustle is about calling best shots all the time without comparing it to anyone else.

What is hustle for you? Feel free to share over comments. ðŸ™‚
