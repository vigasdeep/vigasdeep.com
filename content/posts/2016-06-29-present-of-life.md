It was a fine Monday morning and 9 AM when I woke up, and dark and dense clouds lifted my eyelids towards them as I slept under the stars in the open. A deep breath, and I get to know that rain is coming. I rushed down, and went out on bicycle. After a couple of minutes it started raining, and I was heading towards the city. We all know cities are in rush in the morning, people are going to their work places. With more rain, the streets became empty and people took shelter to avoid getting wet, how unfortunate it may be. These are the most hot and humid days of summer, and all people wish for the rain.. more rain, more rain.

But, when the rain finally came, people started to take shelter. All look at me bathing and cycling in the rain, like I am an alien. Everyone must have their reasons to avoid the rain, but what they miss is far greater, divine and healing then any of their reasons.

People have tendency to seek what they desire and not looking at what they have already. They spend all their lives chasing their desires, and never take a moment to notice what current time is offering them. Chasing your desires is good, it gives purpose to your life, but along with that, one may also learn to see what they have been given at the moment, it is a crucial element to enjoy every moment of life, fully.
