Its 08:21, and following is my current thought process. Thus far I have experienced in life, people you want most in your life, will go away from you sooner than you can imagine. Also, with these regular happenings I have learned the art of letting go, which was orignally very casual to think about, but it got me by the roots when it happened. But hey, this is life, and just like they say, &#8220;Life is not a bed of rosses, but full of thorns&#8221;. I hereby extend my welcome to the biggest possible thorns, and I look forward to them. Lets check out what they got.

I have been hurt, I have been decieved, I have been scolded, I have been burnt inside, I&#8217;ve cried, I have been through other thousand things, but I never stopped (loving, smiling, motivating, empowering) and I never will, till I collapse.

&#8220;When I let go of what I am, I  become what I might be.&#8221; &#8211; Lao Tzu

This is for those people who think they cannot live without anyone, I&#8217;d say, learn to give a good fight to life, if not win. Me personally, I ain&#8217;t here to loose.

&#8220;Success is my only \***\*** option, failure&#8217;s not!&#8221; &#8211; Eminem (Loose Yourself)

Here I am not talking about materialistic success, I am talking about life, and I am going hammer it down.
