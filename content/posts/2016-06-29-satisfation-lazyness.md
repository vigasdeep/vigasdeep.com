I wrote an article, and I mentioned about <a href="https://wp.vigasdeep.com/2016/03/25/the-art-of-knowing/" target="_blank">success</a>, when you read that, you&#8217;ll know that success is a really simple thing. One may feel very lazy and doing like nothing when you know you are successful in living a life, and may not want to add anything to life as everything start to seem perfect. The thought of this satisfaction is like a medicine to long time pained mind and everything relaxes after this medicine. You&#8217;re at peace and this medicine heals you. Its good when you get taste of this medicine, but you you know what they say, excess of everything is bad.

When you are already lazy enough due to thought of being successful and you also get worried about something that you want to do, then you have a purpose to serve. Its something meant to be done by you.&nbsp;If&nbsp;this happens, you have to get up and work that out. All of a sudden this success will seem boring too, and you may love to try things which are beyond your reach.

Now, what is satisfaction to you? ðŸ˜‰
