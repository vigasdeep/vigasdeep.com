I am **Vigas Deep**, born and bred in Ludhiana, Punjab, India.  I am a Information Technology Graduate from [Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College][1], Ludhiana. I&#8217;m a tech lover, curious and willing enough to try anything new and interesting I get my hands on. Before my graduation, I did a three year Computer science and engineering diploma.

Currently, after failing two startups I founded, I&#8217;m on a long journey of knowing how startups work. Currently I&#8217;m working as **Back-end Lead** at [Ryaz][2] and I&#8217;m loving it more and more, everyday.
